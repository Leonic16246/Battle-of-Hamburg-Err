# Battle of Hamburg Err 🍔

Project for Software Development Practice.

In a parallel universe, the delicious world of Hamburg thrives. Hamburg, home to anthropomorphic food items, is a land of unique flavors, where each inhabitant brings their culinary prowess to the table. The peace of this scrumptious world was shattered when a portal to the human world was mistakenly opened by a scientist meddling with the laws of reality.

The portal unleashed a wave of humans whose hunger was amplified by the portal's energy. They began to invade Hamburg with an insatiable appetite, turning this tasty paradise into a battleground: The Battle of Hamburg Err.

Standing against this ravenous threat are the brave defenders of Hamburg:

Hamburger Shooter: Native to the American sector of Hamburg, the Hamburger Shooter uses juicy burger patties as ammo, dishing out high-calorie damage. This unit is renowned for its high damage and rapid fire rate.

Sushi Launcher: From the Japanese sector of Hamburg, the Sushi Launcher utilizes a variety of sushi as explosive projectiles, dealing area of effect damage. Each sushi explosion causes a delectable shockwave that damages groups of invaders.

Donut Laser: The pride of the arid Desert sector, the Donut Laser harnesses the energy within its sugary ring to emit a powerful laser beam, slowing down any human it hits with its sticky sweetness.

As the strategic commander of Hamburg's defenses, your mission is to strategically place and upgrade these food turrets to hold back the waves of hungry humans. Your ultimate goal is to seal the portal and protect Hamburg from this culinary catastrophe.
