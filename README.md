# Battle of Hamburg Err 🍔

Project for Software Development Practice.
Battle of Hamburg Err is a Tower Defense game where you defend your base against enemies by placing towers and upgrading them.

Pick your theme of either America or Japan and place towers including a burger shooter, sushi missile launcher, or donut laser and defend your base against hungry humans that get increasingly tankier and faster as the waves go by!
